#Objective Problem

To boost conversion and engagement in the ruparupa platform, we need to understand the behaviour and the profile of our customer by classifying a customer to a certain
category.

Example: Customer's profile tells us which device most used
by the user or which city most users come from and. With
that profile information, we can put our marketing effort to
target similar audiences that have high conversion rate
probability and which user that we have to put focus on.
